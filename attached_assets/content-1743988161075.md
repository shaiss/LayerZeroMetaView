Overview

lzRead is a data primitive that allows smart contract developers to access onchain data from any supported network in a single function call.Deploy anywhere, unlock data from everywhere.

02 / 04

Benefits

Why lzRead?

A /

Quick Setup

Access any supported chain’s data in just a few lines of code, letting you focus on building impactful solutions.

B /

Unified Development

Retrieve data across all chains using standardized methods, simplifying cross-chain workflows.

C /

Custom Security

Security is configured by each application's choice of decentralized verifier networks (DVNs). This also determines compute and speed capabilities.

D /

Cost-Effective

Pay as you go model means you only pay fees when you make data requests - keeping operational costs low and predictable.

Use Cases

Build with lzRead [Talk to Expert](https://layerzeronetwork.typeform.com/to/YaeE8T71)

Prove

\[ 01 \]

lzRead verifies cross-chain asset ownership, user actions, and more without costly gas fees or delays.

Price

\[ 02 \]

lzRead enables historical pricing data to be aggregated across chains and TWAP/VWAP to be calculated, providing DeFi Protocols access to reliable, competitive pricing data to create a better trading experience.

Govern

\[ 03 \]

lzRead aggregates voting power across chains which allows token holders to vote once from any chain, simplifying onchain governance for all DAOs and protocols.

Sync

\[ 04 \]

lzRead synchronizes liquidity pools across chains, enabling seamless emission distribution, cross-chain deposits, minting, and liquidity management.

/ 01

Any Data

Receive raw blockchain state from one chain, many chains, or add compute to transform data and receive back a simplified payload.

/ 02

Any Chain

With unified semantics, lzRead is designed to scale. Developers can utilize read from any blockchain with smart contracts.

/ 03

Any Period of Time

Historical onchain data is accessible across any chain, opening up new possibilities for crypto-native applications.
